## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-08

First prerelease.

### Added

- Quota ingestion from T3's provider event logs for Codex (`primary`,
  `secondary`, spending) and Claude (`five_hour`, `seven_day`, model-specific
  weekly windows), with rotation-safe tailing and persisted read positions.
- Policy state machine per bucket and reset epoch: warn at 85%, drain at 90%
  with a grace period, stop at 95%, rearm on a confirmed reset.
- T3 control over the orchestration HTTP API: warn and drain messages,
  interrupt or session stop with verification and escalation, opt-in
  automatic resume with per-provider staggering and cancellation on manual
  interaction.
- Commands: `init`, `check`, `run`, `status`, `replay`, `install-service`,
  `uninstall-service`, `version`.
- Linux systemd user service installer. macOS and Windows binaries run in the
  foreground.
- SQLite audit log and state, dry-run by default, no telemetry.
