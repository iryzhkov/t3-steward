# Fix-chain rules

Read the complete original brief at .t3/inputs/inputs/fix/brief/prompt.md and every file under .t3/inputs/inputs/fix/brief/inputs/. Read context under .t3/inputs/inputs/fix/context/. Keep the original scope, acceptance criteria and base constraints.

Create continuation.md immediately and keep its goal, checklist, current step, blockers and last verification current. Only declared artifacts are retained. List .t3/dependencies/ to discover producer directories; never hard-code dependency namespaces. Read commit provenance records and check out the exact dependency commit before work; never invent a moving branch or base.

Fixers: reproduce every review finding with a failing regression test before implementation. Run focused checks, then a native self-review swarm with separate failure/error, crash/restart/replay/concurrency, real deployment/macOS, limits/malformed-input lenses, and adversarial bypass when security relevant. Report a finding only with a reproducing failing test or command; record unreproduced notes separately. Fix every reproduced finding and record verification commands and exit codes. Perform the test-integrity check by listing removed existing test lines with git diff <original-base> -- '*_test.go'; justify every removal or change and never weaken an assertion to pass. Keep focused verification in fix rounds; the worker runs the declared final gate outside the agent turn. Commit relevant source and regression tests, declare HEAD as fix, and leave a clean tracked tree.

Reviewers never modify source or commit. Review against the entire original brief and acceptance criteria, rerun focused checks, and reproduce suspected defects before requesting changes. review.md starts with exactly VERDICT: ACCEPT or VERDICT: CHANGES_REQUESTED. Write verdict.json as {"verdict":"accept","blocking_findings":0,"finding_titles":[]} or {"verdict":"changes-requested","blocking_findings":N,"finding_titles":["title"]}; keep both outputs consistent.

No-op rule: a fixer receiving an accept verdict checks out the preceding fix commit unchanged and declares that commit as fix. Write handoff.md and verification.log as "no-op: preceding review accepted <commit>". A final reviewer of a no-op carries the preceding accept only after checking the worker gate result, when a gate is declared. A failed gate must not be carried as acceptance.

Never submit nested campaigns, tasks or reviews. Do not claim acceptance as a fixer.
